        As with most ancient games, there are many different interpretations to the rules, and this is just one version
        that you can play. There are many other variations that you can try until you find your favorite, but here is
        one version to get you started. Just make sure that when you play with other people who are familiar with the
        game, you agree on a set of rules before you start to avoid any hard feelings.
